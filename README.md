# dodgeball V1.0
My dodgeball javascript game with node.js and socket.io

To get this to work you need to do <number> of steps

1. First download the code and put it in a folder.
2. Install Node.js on your compueter (it is different on different OS)
3. When you have installed write "npm init" when you are in your map with the files and follow the steps.
4. Then type "npm install express"
5. And also type "npm install socket.io" . This will install the two packages that we need.
6. Now in your promt and in you folder tpye "node app.js". This should start the server.
7. Then open your client.html file inside client folder and you should be connected

Have fun playing the game!
